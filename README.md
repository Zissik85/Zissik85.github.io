Name: Michael McGhee

Overview: Made a basic burger restraunt site

Offers(functionality): Nav bar, bootstrap carousel with menu as the photos, contact us page has a working form.

Tech used: I have HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap on the page currently, and form is working with formspree.

Ideas for future improvements: A more sleek look with more interactive features with javascript, I need to lean how to use @media to fit the pages better to different devices. Would look better if I played around with the fonts more, and changed them based on section as well.
