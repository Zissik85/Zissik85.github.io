                    <p>&nbsp; My name is Mike, I am thirty-four and I am married and have two boys.<br>
        Previously I was a Truck Driver, and now I am trying to switch carrers <br>
        so that I can spend more time with my family.</p>

            <h2>What I Hope For the Future</h2>
                    <p>I am hoping to do well in this course, to change my carrer so that I am not<br>
                    away from home twenty days of the month. I'd like to make sure my wife<br>
                    does not feel like a single parent, and we can afford a <strong>comfortable</strong> life together.
                    </p>
