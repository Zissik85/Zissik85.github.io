    <br>
    <p>Around 1992, Reginold Woligan decided he wanted to make a better burger.
       He too was tired of the dry, flavorless burgers you find today. After securing a loan from a now extinct bank,
       Reginold was finally able to start his dream. His first few trials were not only tasteless, but costly. 
       <br><br>Because he had no prior experience in cooking, his loan was not a large one to start with, and within just over a week 
       he had blown through about 60% of his loan. But after <em>22 days</em> of trial and error, he succeded.
       We are the product of his mediocre efforts to bring you a patty that was not dry.</p>
